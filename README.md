## Technology stack

The project is primarily built using Flutter, a dart-based kit from Google for mobile application development. In order to provide additional functionalities to the application, however, other services have been integrated in the project. These are:
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com): a set of Google services which was used to handle authentication ([Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth)) and for the implementation of the database ([Firebase Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore));
- [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com): a powerful search engine that allows to overcome Firebase shortcomings in query formulation.

All the aforementioned services were available, at the time of development, with free plans for testing.
